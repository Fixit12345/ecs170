\begin{enumerate}
\item 
We use a feed-forward neural network with a single hidden layer and stochastic gradient descent. A feed-forward neural network was chosen due to its simplicity and ability to approximate any function. Our network is partially connected, due to the fact that our input layer does not directly connect to the output layer (only by proxy through the hidden layer), as is common with feed forward network designs. We chose to use only a single hidden layer to minimize potential overfitting that could occur with a more complex hidden layer design. We use 20 nodes to roughly approximate the number of key features differentiable through the network. Such features could include jawline, nose-size, hair, etc. Though somewhat arbitrary, we feel that a size of 20 would allow for key facial features to be represented without a high potential for overfitting as would occur with a large number of nodes that could pertain to set-specific anomalies.

Our network operates as follows. We take each .txt file as input, and use forward propagation to come up with a "hypothesis" for the sex of the subject. We determining its error, and then run back propagation to update the weights for the next round.
